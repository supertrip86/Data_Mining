# ADM-HW2

The main file of the assignment is the Jupyter Notebook named "hw-2.ipynb", all the functions called by this file are stored in "functions.py". A separate notebook containing answers to RQ4 and RQ5, named "ADMRQ4RQ5.ipynb", has been added at the very last minute (right before the deadline), and therefore couldn't be added to the main one.
All files are located at the root of the repository.

The main notebook has been processed entirely by a local machine with the following specifications:

- Operative System: Windows 10 Professional x64 
- CPU: Intel Core i7 8700K
- Motherboard: Gigabyte Z390 Gaming X-CF
- RAM: 2x16 GB DDR4 4200 Mhz
- **NO** dedicated GPU

The total processing time for the whole notebook, with the machine indicated, is 34 minutes. Most of this time comes from RQ1-5 and RQ1-6 (around 12 minutes each).

The entire assignment was done with the October 2019 and November 2019 datasets.
